## Adding and deleting tuples
- Can insert a single tuple using INSERT
## Truncate table
- Can DELETE all tuples satisfying some condition.

This removes all the rows from the table
- This operation is faster than the delete statement without the where clouse.
- Syntax:
  - truncate table table_name
    - example
      - Truncate table Sailors;
- The TRUNCATE TABLE statement does not trigger ON DELETE triggers.

## Updating Data

UPDATE table_reference SET assignment_list [WHERE where_condition][order_by .....] [LIMIT row_count] value: {expr | DEFAULT} assignment: col_name = value

## SELECT SENTENCE

->FROM -> table specifications
->WHERE -> search conditions
->GROUP BY -> grouping column
->HAVING -> grouping column
->ORDER BY -> sort of specification
